What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You set the foundation for a commit. The .git directory saves everything it takes to save and checkout commits.
Without a .git, one cannot commit files and there is no way to use it as a version control.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

The staging area is where you "ckeck in" files before committing them in the repository. So repositories is a saved version 
of at least one file in an important state. The working directory is the directory, where all files and the .git file are
stored.
