When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When I or multiple persons want to access the repository from multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It's the same issue as we discussed earlier. Git doesnt know when it makes sense 
to make a commit or upload changes. Also, no one I work with is interested in 
code that I haven't finished yet. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Forking is for cloning a repository on the website GITHub from another user, so that in my forked repository users see
who the actual author is (not me). Cloning is done completely locally or between GITHub and my local machine. Branches 
are created when making commits that are not supposed to go with the master branch, b/c you wanna try s.th. out or
develope a new language version. After making sure that the branch works, it can be merged with the master and the new
features or languages would be added to the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
